# Store-Management-UI
A basic offline store management user interface designed with C++ and Qt.

This is a tab based Qt application. It includes two tabs called "General Store" and "Kits". 
In General Store tab, you can add materials, their units, unit cost and descriptions. On the
other tab called "Kits", you can create kits and add materials created on first page. Customize
the amount of each material included and visualize the total cost of the kits.

Kit and Material data can be saved offline.

It's a very simple cost calculation and tracking application running on Windows OS.
